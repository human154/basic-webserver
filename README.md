# Basic Web Server for [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/)

A webserver [platform](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/wiki/Roc-concepts-explained#platform) with a simple interface.

Write a function which takes a `Http.Request`, perform I/O like fetching content or reading environment variables, and return a `Http.Response`. It's that easy!

Behind the scenes, `basic-webserver` uses Rust's high-performance [hyper](https://hyper.rs) and [tokio](https://tokio.rs) libraries to execute your Roc function on incoming requests.

:warning: On linux `--linker=legacy` is necessary for this package because of [this Roc issue](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/3609).

## Example

Hello world webserver:

```elixir
app "helloweb"
    packages { pf: "https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-webserver/releases/download/0.4.0/iAiYpbs5zdVB75golcg_YMtgexN3e2fwhsYPLPCeGzk.tar.br" }
    imports [
        pf.Stdout,
        pf.Task.{ Task },
        pf.Http.{ Request },
        pf.Response.{ Response },
        pf.Utc,
    ]
    provides [main] to pf

main : Request -> Task Response []
main = \req ->
    # Log request date, method and request path
    date = Utc.now! |> Utc.toIso8601Str
    Stdout.line! "$(date) $(Http.methodToStr req.method) $(req.path)"

    Response.ok [] (Str.toUtf8 "<b>Hello, world!</b>\n")
```

Run this example server with `$ roc run helloweb.roc --linker=legacy` and go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## Steps to re-generate glue

Run the following from the repository root directory.

1. Run `bash platform/glue-gen.sh`
2. Manually fix any issues with glue generated code in `platform/glue-manual/*.rs`, this is a temporary workaround and should not be needed in future
